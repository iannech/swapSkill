# swapSkill
Android app 

# About
Swap lets users do each other's task and exchange stuff in a fun way. 
Users can do each other's assignments or carry out physical tasks on behalf of other people.
Users in one location can exchange Games, Movies plus more..

A "handshake" is the binding feature in the app. 

# Handshake
From a list of available Tasks, a user can "TAP" on one -> to open an activity with more info about the task -> At the bottom is a handshake icon which the user taps to send handshake(this means a person is ready to do the task)-> Task owner receives a handshake request notification -> Tapping back means they've accepted to have their task done by the first user -> The two users will then exchange contacts (email address + phone number should do). 


# Target 
Students are the primary target but everyone is free to use.
Once profile is complete, they'll fill in all the skills they possess and wanna share with world.
Users can add items they wish to exchange to their inventory . 

Once a user has completed their profile setup, they immediately gain access to the swapSkill platform:-

	- They can see items for exchange around their location.
	- They can search for a particular Skill and see a listing of all the people with the same skill.
	- They can Search for people - Trying to access people's profile is only possible if they are around your location(not sure of this yet).
	- Shake hands to do a task/request an exchange of an item.
	- Accept a Handshake for someone to do your task/exchange item .
